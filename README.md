# Brain Stroke Prediction uisng Machine Learning
Dataset for brain stroke is obtained from kaggle. 

#### Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset/code

On this dataset, we used different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost to accurately predict brain stroke and show the accuracy, recall, precision, F1 SCore as well as Confusion Matrix and conduction 5 fold and 10 fold cross validation.
